**Weight Goal Calculator**

A simple and intuitive application designed to help users understand the relationship between their caloric intake and weight goals. This project is part of my journey as a software developer, focusing on logic implementation and user input processing.

## 📖 About the Project

This application allows users to calculate how long it will take to reach a specific weight goal based on their daily calorie intake, or conversely, how many calories they should eat to reach their goal by a specific date.

It uses standard metabolic formulas to estimate the **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** and **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**.

## ✨ Features

*   **User Profile:** Input key metrics including biological sex, height, weight, age, and physical activity level.
*   **Goal Setting:** Define a specific target weight.
*   **Flexible Calculation Modes:**
    *   **By Calories:** Input your daily calorie limit -> The app calculates the estimated **end date**.
    *   **By Date:** Input your target date -> The app calculates the required **daily calorie budget**.
*   **Instant Feedback:** Clear display of the calculated results based on the inputs.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers & Health Warnings

**Please read this before using the application.**

### 1. Developer Disclaimer
I am a software developer in training. This application is a personal practice project created to improve my coding skills. **I am not a nutritionist, doctor, or health expert.** The algorithms used here are standard mathematical approximations (like the Mifflin-St Jeor equation) and should be viewed as rough estimates only. They do not account for individual metabolic differences, medical conditions, or body composition.

### 2. Health & Safety
*   **Consult a Professional:** Always consult with a doctor or a registered dietitian before starting any weight loss journey or significantly changing your diet.
*   **Calorie Deficits:** A high calorie deficit is not suitable for everyone and can be dangerous. Sustainable weight management is a slow process.
*   **Accuracy:** The numbers provided by this app are mathematical estimates, not biological facts.

### 3. A Note on Mental Health ❤️
If you have a history of eating disorders or if you find that tracking numbers, weight, or calories negatively affects your mental health or causes anxiety, **please do not use this app.** Your well-being is more important than any number on a scale. If you are struggling, please reach out to a professional or a support hotline in your country.

## 🚀 Roadmap

I am currently working on expanding the functionality of this app. Future updates may include:
*   Visual graphs for weight progression.
*   Saving user profiles locally.
*   Macro-nutrient breakdown (Protein, Carbs, Fats).
